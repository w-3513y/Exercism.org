# roadmap

in this project I'll be putting c# concepts to quick consult. It will be a metric for my studies: code challenges as exercism.org, hackerrank, etc. ,  for test new management structs as azure devops and to put mini examples of use of tecnologies as rabbitMQ, docker, etc.

## Usage

as I said it will be only for quick consults

## Installation

for now you just need dotnet 6.0 installed on your pc

## Roadmap

this section will be increased:

Microsoft:
- dotnet 6.0 and csharp 10 (ok)

Others:
- Swagger
- azure devops
